Our goal is to deliver business value through data. We have created an AI-driven analytics product called Pythia. The platform is designed to enable marketeers to leverage the power of AI to interrogate, and get answers from, all of their customer, operational, transactional and digital data. These outputs can range from producing simple answers to quantitative questions, through to creating digital segmentation, undertaking journey analysis, predictive analytics, and beyond. The easiest way to conceptualise Pythia is to think of it like Jarvis from Iron Man - a 24/7 digital insights assistant - or more broadly, an AI co-pilot for data exploration. We are building the tool to be both self-service as a SaaS platform, and to be offered via a managed service. Pythia will support our internal teams to do their work better, as well as being sold to clients. We have built the MVP platform, but need to scale it dramatically and this role is to support that development. Background Mezzo Labs have been operating from our London HQ since 2007, and have around 30 people in the UK. We then set up the Hong Kong office in May 2018, and Singapore in January 2020. We were acquired by The MISSION Group PLC in February 2023, and have joined a group of 1,200 marketing experts as their data and MarTech agency. Our projects range from individual MarTech & data projects (such as an Adobe Analytics implementation, or Tableau dashboard build) through to a fully retained programmes delivering all of our services over a 12-to-36-month programme. Our work is primarily Hong Kong and Singapore based, although we plan to win clients in other markets around the region. Many of our Global clients are in financial services, and we have a broad mix of Travel & Hospitality, Healthcare, Telco and eCommerce clients in APAC.

Our goal is to deliver business value through data.We have created an AI-driven analytics product called Pythia. The platform is designed to enable marketeers to leverage the power of AI to interrogate, and get answers from, all of their customer, operational, transactional and digital data. These outputs can range from producing simple answers to quantitative questions, through to creating digital segmentation, undertaking journey analysis, predictive analytics, and beyond. The easiest way to conceptualise Pythia is to think of it like Jarvis from Iron Man - a 24/7 digital insights assistant - or more broadly, an AI co-pilot for data exploration.We are building the tool to be both self-service as a SaaS platform, and to be offered via a managed service. Pythia will support our internal teams to do their work better, as well as being sold to clients.We have built the MVP platform, but need to scale it dramatically and this role is to support that development. BackgroundMezzo Labs have been operating from our London HQ since 2007, and have around 30 people in the UK. We then set up the Hong Kong office in May 2018, and Singapore in January 2020.
